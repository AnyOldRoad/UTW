### What is this?

Under The Wrekin is a blog about AFC Telford United, and occasionally I write about other topics relating to crap football. 

It is not in any way affiliated with AFC Telford United, The National League, or anyone else - it's just some words that tumble out of my head onto a page in a particular order, based on my opinions, which are worth precisely what you've already paid for them.

The title refers to [the medieval name for Wellington in Shropshire](https://lovewellington.uk/local-history/), the town where the club is from. The Wrekin is a large hill in East Shropshire, the foot of which is around a mile from the Bucks Head.

### Who are you?

I worked as a local news journalist for a few years across the border in mid Wales which taught me how to string a sentence together. I started out in journalism with the new defunct North Wales News media group as a staff photographer.

I've been a supporter since I was about 7 years old, about 35 years ago. In that time I've also done a few volunteer media roles for the club, and my first ever paid job after leaving school was as a YTS groundsman at the pre-redevelopment Bucks Head (I was not very good at it).

I've seen Telford play in the fourth round of the FA Cup, in grim midweek league fixtures at places like Clitheroe and Shepshed Dynamo, and lots of other largely forgettable places in between. I would like to see us play at least one game in the football league before I die.
