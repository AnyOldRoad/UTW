They say you can tell you're getting older when the footballers start looking younger - when the managers are mostly junior to you it's definitely time to admit defeat.

There's something deeply unnerving when you work out that these guys, these battle hardened leaders of men, these wisened old sea-dogs of non league football management are probably broadly in the same stages of making-it-up-as-you-go-along as you are.

A few years ago I had a mini mid-life crisis when I realised Gavin Cowan is a year younger than I am, but as I've now nudged over the 40 mark the sensation has become less of a rarity and not entirely welcome at that. So imagine my delight to discover that Chester gaffer Calum McIntyre is all of 28-years young, drawing many of you into the hurriedly encroaching middle-aged shadow realms in which I now more frequently reside.

McIntyre has had an electric start to football management, first with Runcorn and now with Chester, who have surged to third in the National North under his fresh-faced leadership, sitting proudly at the top of the form table if not the actual table, having taken 24 points from the last 30 on offer.

What better time then, for the swaggering Cestrian hordes to visit the New Bucks Head and give it the Boxing Day big 'un?
Never entirely shy in coming forward, big-club-Chester's recent flush of success should see them well backed this weekend on what, I'm afraid, could turn out to be a rather long afternoon for all of us. 

But if you needed a wily, been-there-and-done-it National League type with a substantial box of tricks to reach into against a fella who's likely to still be asked for ID for a tin of dark fruits in a supermarket, you'd probably be on the phone to someone like Kevin Wilkin, although it's likely even his extensively-thumbed management manual is being extended by a few chapters at the moment.

The reality for Wilkin and the Bucks though is that, despite the odds, the players have to find a way to win quickly, or festive double headers with Chester, who we've faced for the past three years over the Christmas and New Year period, could be replaced with the rather less glamorous prospect of Stafford Rangers or Nantwich.

Despite an improved display in the FA Trophy during mmid-week, the Bucks once again ran out of steam after about 70 minutes at Solihull, a frequent feature of this campaign which leads you to wonder further what on earth was going on during pre-season when they were supposed to be at training. At this stage of the season, it's hard to know what can be done about it although Wilkin has clearly instructed the players to work on it in their own time.

"We have made inroads into levels of intensity and fitness and need to continue to do so," he told club media in the aftermath of Tuesday's FA Trophy defeat to Solihull.

"It’s important they work hard away from when we are together and live in the right way and make sure their fitness levels are up there with what is required. We need to improve that. It has improved, but it’s not improving enough."

Attempting to bridge the gap will be new signing Luke Rowe, who will doubtless be thrilled to get out of Cannock and is available having been cup-tied for Solihull. You would have to expect that he will be included.

With the two games against Chester set to roll over into a busy seven game January it's already looking a bit now-or-never - overcoming tall odds is going to be a feature of the next 21 games if the club has any hope of survival.

"We're running out of games and we need to stay on the shirt tails of those above us," Wilkin added.

"We recognise how important that is and that message should be loud and clear to all the players... we need to start crystallising these moments and chances into goals which will give us a chance to go on and win games."

If that sounds like an exercise in stating the obvious then ok - but sometimes it really is that simple.
