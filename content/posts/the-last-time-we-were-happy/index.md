A lot of people are suggesting we'd need a miracle to avoid relegation this season, and in fairness they are probably right - but a change is as good as a rest they say, and while you're in the middle of attempting a miraculous escape from the drop, what better change of pace could you ask for from attempting to pull off a miraculous win in the cup?

<!--more-->

Perhaps I'm giving too much credit to Solihull Moors, possibly the unlikeliest of giants in a David vs Goliath style clash, but it would undoubtedly require something spectacular to see us progress any further in the FA Trophy.

We do have a bit of form though, in the shape of our most recent visit to Damson Park in 2019 which, in case you might have forgotten, saw Dan Udoh smash in a late winner and Andy Wycherley save a stoppage time penalty to take us into the semi finals of the competition, back in those halcyon days when you could argue we were still sort-of good.

Think back to that explosion of joy when Udoh latched onto that hapless mis-kick from Ryan Boot, danced around the Solihull 'keeper's despairing dive and rolled the ball into the net from an almost impossible angle to make it 2-1 in front of an ecstatic away end. The players piled on Udoh in the corner, fans danced on the pitch, and Gavin Cowan let out that guttural roar as the whistle blew on a fixture which probably represented the high tide-mark of his stint in charge.

Was this the last time we were really, truly happy? Probably. Those days are gone now.

Not three years later and while we find ourselves where we are, the Moors have remained on that gentle upward curve to the point where the traditional polarity of the two clubs has been decisively reversed; Solihull the established national league outfit with Telford the perennial scrappers at the wrong end of the regional league below.

Now under the stewardship of early-premier-league-famous former Wimbledon defender Neal Ardley, Solihull sit 7th in the National League, and seem set for another tilt at the football league having narrowly missed out in last year's play-off final. 
Ardley's side emerged from a poor run of six games without a win with a 2-1 victory over Oldham Athletic at the start of December as leading scorer Andrew Dallas notched his 9th league goal of the campaign against the struggling Latics, but have been frustrated by weather-related postponements since then.

We head into this fixture on the closest thing to a run of form we've had all season. Those last six games, including the cup tie at Kings Langley *ahem*:  LLWLWL. Basically mid-table stuff.

That list might have shown three wins from the last four games, but for losing narrowly to the odd goal in one on a bitterly cold night at Bradford (Park Avenue) last week, perhaps a predictable enough outcome in itself but a fixture which also included what Kevin Wilkin described as "the best 45 minutes we've played" since he took over. 

Taken in isolation, it would be easy to be cynical about this statement, particularly given that he was referring to the first half and we were 1-0 down at the break. 
But he's right, the yawning ability gap between us and the rest of the division is narrowing and besides, I have always admired the ability of football managers to be able to completely disregard the minor detail of how many goals have gone in at either end when assessing a performance. How else could you keep going in Wilkin's shoes, I suppose?

That improvement has certainly coincided with the gradual turnover of players which started when Wilkin took over two months ago, and while I'm sure he would have liked it to have happened more quickly, it is undoubtedly tough to bring players in with the club sat so decisively at the foot of the table.

However, the Bucks will welcome two new signings ahead of the weekend, and one of them is even permanent. 

Former Wolverhampton Wanderers and Coventry City midfielder Luke Rowe has swapped the dreary black country business-park surroundings of Hednesford for the bright lights of East Shropshire until the end of the season, despite the pitmen reportedly launching wads of Â£20 notes at him with a t-shirt cannon while he made off up the A5 as quickly as he could. Meanwhile Josh O'Brien becomes the latest 19-year-old football league defender to try his luck on loan at the foot of the National North, joining from Salford for a month.

Will it be enough for the Bucks to somehow pull off the sequel to the 2019 Miracle of Damson Park? It seems unlikely the Moors will be shaking too hard in their Armco-branded boots, but owing to the unpredictable beauty of football, and I daresay the good old 'magic-o'-the-cup' you just never know do you?

It is the season for miracles, after all.
